5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git allows for versions to exist without having to run around handing files to your coworkers, or worse having a coworker having to put all the files together at the end of a project. It makes it easier to work on many parts of a project
together with a team without having conflicts, and makes it easier for project managers to review and merge code. Git also supplies teams with non-repudiation, which is especially important in secure environments. If you pushed bad code, and
said bad code broke the entire codebase - you cannot say it wasn't you and cats don't know how to git add, git commit, git push... yet.
